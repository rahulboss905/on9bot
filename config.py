# Running locally (YOU MUST MAKE SURE YOU ARE RUNNING Python 3.6+, I USE F-STRINGS):
# You only need to copy the .py files (excluding trash.py) from the repo to a folder.
# Run "pip install python-telegram-bot" if you haven't. Remember to update it.
# Fill in the required information in config.py.
# Add a environmental variable with the name "debug" and value "yes".*
# Running the bot in PyCharm: Open On9bot.py, scroll to the bottom and press the run button on the left.
# Running the bot in cmd: cd to folder containing On9bot.py and run "python3 On9bot.py". Use Ctrl+C to stop the bot.

# *Adding environmental variables in PyCharm (If you are going to run the bot in PyCharm):
# You may go to the right top corner of the editor and press the leftmost button with a scroll down menu.
# Select Edit Configurations and you should be at the "Configuration" tab.
# Under the "Environment" section, click the "..." button besides the "Environmental variables" line.
# Select the "+" sign, type "debug" on the left and "yes" on the right.
# Press OK to close the window, then press Apply.
# You have added the environmental variable and make sure to run the code in PyCharm as well.


# Deploying to Heroku
# You will need to copy all the files (excluding trash.py, README.md and LICENSE.md) in the repo to a folder.
# Fill in the required information in config.py.
# Create an account on Heroku.
# Download Heroku on https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python#set-up so you can run it on cmd.
# Cd to the folder containing the On9bot files (run "cd {directory name}" in cmd)
# Run the following commands:

# heroku create (run "heroku create appname" if you would like to specify a name, else a random one will be given)
# git init
# heroku git:remote -a {your heroku app name}
# git add .
# git commit -am "{commit message}"*
# git push heroku master*

# *From now on, you have to run these two commands when you push changes.
